# Team-profile-generator 

The purpose of this project was to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. hen the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user.

* This app runs as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

* There are also unit tests ran to help you build the classes necessary to export user information.

* The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team, and that displays a nicely formatted team roster in browser.

 # Installation

To run this locally, use node js in the terminal.  

## Usage
